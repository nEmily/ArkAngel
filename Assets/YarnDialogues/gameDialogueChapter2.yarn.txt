Object: Riley...
Riley: Leave me alone!
Object: ...
Object: I know just as well as you how this must feel.
Object: Losing Mom, Dad...all my friends... everyone. 
Object: But I kept going. Forced myself to wake up every morning, eat breakfast, then go to the basement to work on the spaceship that would allow me to leave the Arkangel.
Object: It's tough - learning everything about spaceships and the physics behind it on my own, building different prototypes and failing every time -
Object: I wanted to give up everyday.
Object: But at the end, it was worth it. After 13 years, I left Arkangel behind on the new spaceship, and began the new journey through space.
Object: Along my way, I discovered exotic planets, new types of stars, and sometimes I would come across other spaceship, where I would stay for a couple of weeks.
Object: It never stopped hurting. When I first communicated with you, and saw all of them still alive and walking around - I did not expect it to hurt like it did.
Object: But this is what happened. There was nothing that either of us could have done to have prevented this. 
Object: Living has been... more hurt than happiness, more pain than sweetness...
Object: Yet, if I were given a choice to live this life again, I wouldn't change a thing.
Riley: Why?
Object: Because it was all worth it.
    -> Really?
        [[HappyEnding]]
    -> I don't believe you.

Object: To save you, of course.
Riley: What about Mom and Dad? Athena? Johnson?
Object: Riley... I could only save one of you, and the reality of my present dictates that you must live. There is no choice.
Riley: There is always a choice.
Object: Is there? I come from the future. Every choice you've made and every word you've used... I remember it all.
Riley: I...
Object: ...don't believe you.
Object: Time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future, and time future contained in time past. 
Object: Riley, I had no choice. You are destined to live.
Riley: ...
Riley: What am I living for? There's only me left. Everyone's dead.
Object: It's tough, and I know I cannot convince you now. But years later, you will have built your own spaceship, and you will be leaving ARKANGEL to embark on a new journey.
Object: Eventually, you will find new meaning in life. It'll never stop hurting, but it will get better.
    -> Really?
        [[HappyEnding]]
    -> Then I don't want to get better.
        Object: What do you mean?
        Riley: I don't want to get better. I don't want to be you.
        Object: I am you, Riley.
        Riley: No, you are not. We always have a choice. You chose your path. I'm choosing my own path.
        Object: And how do you think you are going to accomplish that? I'm the living proof that you are wrong.

Riley: I'm throwing this away.
Object: What?
Riley: I'm taking the watch off.
Object: Riley, you don't know what you are doing!
Riley: Once I took the watch off, I won't be protected, and I'll be frozen forever like everyone else, right?
Object: Yes! So why are you doing this?
Riley: What else is there to live for? Mom, Dad... I can't do this without them.
Object: Riley!

Object: Yes, really.
Riley: What should I do now?
Object: Rest for a day or two. Then you've got to start working towards building your own ARKANGEL.
Riley: How do I even begin?
Object: Start with basic physics. You have all the books your parents left you on cosmology. Then, after that, you'll need to start designing your ARKANGEL.
Riley: ... will you be here to help?
Object: ...
Object: I cannot. I am already pushing the limits - one minute of interstitial dimension phone call costs two million gummies. One minute more and I'll be in debt!
Riley: Gummies?
Object: International space currency. Gummy bears are very resistant to space radiation.
Riley: Oh, ok.
Object: Riley...
Object: Take care, alright?
Riley: Ok.
Object: Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Riley: I won't.
Object: Ok. See you.
Riley: See you.
